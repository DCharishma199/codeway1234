            <h2>WHERE WORDS FAIL<BR>MUSIC SPEAKS</h2>
                <h5>Gospel--</h5>
                <p><b>The very first popular music genres came from a variety of influences but the foundations were laid in the United States. Before Blues and Jazz developed themselves, a number of “proto-genres” responsible for that development, were already known and popular throughout the country: Ragtime, Stride, Jug Bands, and Skiffle. But the most important one was Gospel. Gospel evolved from the fragile voice from black slaves into an undeniably huge genre with many subgenres. Gospel shakes off pretty fast its racial dimension: black and white join hand in hand to sing the song of God. Because Gospel is more about faith than about race; about believing in a better world and future and connecting different souls.

                    As Gospel expands and diversifies, questions are raised about the integrity of some artists and the music itself. Are some in it for the money or do they really speak the word of the Lord? Nowadays, Gospel is rarely a part of mainstream music media but without it, there would be no Rhythm ‘n’ Blues or perhaps even no popular music at all. However, in many churches and religious communities (especially in the southern part of the US) Gospel lives on strongly and is heavily produced, sung and experienced in sermons that induce ecstatic bliss in listeners, the likes other subcultures have never seen.
